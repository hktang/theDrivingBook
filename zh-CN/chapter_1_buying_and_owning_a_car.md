## 我可以在日本买车、开车吗？

### Q: 我可以在日本开车吗？

A: 可以。只要你拥有日本驾照，或者**同时持有**国际驾照和母国有效驾照，即可在日本开车。在入国首日起的最长一年时间内，你可以持国际驾照在日本开车。单靠母国驾照不可以开车，连租车也不行！除非你来自德国、法国或者瑞士——这种情况下，你还必须持有驾照的官方日文翻译件。如要开摩托车，你必须拥有母国家颁发的有效摩托车驾照。

### Q: 哪里可以申领国际驾照？

A: 最简单的办法就是出国之前在当地机动车协会申领（译注：中国大陆地区？呵呵）。即使你已经身在日本，一般也可以通过邮递服务获得。只能从自己的国家获取国际驾照。请选用正规机构，谨防上当受骗。（ 各大机动车协会列表详见： http://drivers.com/article/207/ ）。法律规定，国际驾照有效期最长一年，不能更新——除非你在母国连续逗留三个月以上。

### Q: 我可以在日本拥有汽车吗？

A: 可以。外国人允许在日本拥有汽车。只要你愿意，你的雇主机构无权阻挠你买车或用车，甚至开车上班。但是，他们有权限制你开自己的车往返于不同工作场所。有些单位会想你提供汽车或帮你购买汽车，有些单位会设法打消你买车的念头。

## 哪款适合我？
日本的汽车种类众多。各种大小的汽车、摩托车和踏板车都允许上路，牌照制度、交通规则和费用各不相同。要根据你的需求来决定买什么样的机动车。如果你只是偶尔需要进城，可以考虑体积较小的汽车或者踏板车。如果你想带上三五知己一起去巡访日本道路，不妨购买体积和排量都相对较大的车。如果是平常上下班之用，那往往只取决于个人的偏好。

### 踏板车
排量50cc以下的踏板车（译注：中国大陆又称轻便摩托车、小毛驴、小电驴等）适用于在天气尚可的条件下在城市内低速穿梭，如果你打算开踏板车的话，购买流程还算方便，而且大部分的购买手续都可以让摩托车店家代劳。你可以申请一个专门的踏板车驾照，该驾照和普通驾照并无关系。只要通过笔试和参加一节讲座，便可以获得踏板车驾照，不需要路考。详见“笔试”一章。

### 摩托车
注意，无论是哪种摩托车，如果要在日本国内使用国际驾照驾驶，那么你的母国驾照必须注明允许驾驶摩托车，一般汽车驾照还不够。日本的摩托车驾照有两种：普通摩托车驾照适用于 50cc 以上 400 cc （含）以下的摩托车，大型摩托车驾照适用于 401cc 和更高排量的摩托车。

关于在日本驾驶踏板车和摩托车的所有及一切资料，请阅读 Japan Biker FAQ http://www.thejapanfaq.com/bikerfaq-toc.html （英文）。

### 汽车
汽车大致分两种：

 ● **白牌车**：顾名思义，这种白色车牌的汽车和世界上其他国家一般车辆看起来没有什么不同。白牌车一般比黄牌车更宽敞、安全，马力也更大，买车和养车也相对较贵。白牌车并不需要满足特定大小，但车身总是比黄牌车要宽。

 ● **黄牌车**：黄牌车的车身较窄，多用于市镇街道。腿部空间和后备箱空间都不怎么多。黄牌车要费一番功夫才能勉强达到高速公路的最高限速，而且也相对没那么安全。不过，黄牌车的购买和使用都便宜很多。 

#### 买车
无论是新车还是二手车，购买途径都有两种：一是经销商，而是个人。从经销商处购买的好处是，他们会办理很多种手续。质量也能得到一定的保证。经个人途径购买的好处是，价格可能会低很多。如果你想向个人购买，但又不希望办理各种手续，你可以自费找一家经销商或者地方运输局的人员代办。

买车时，以下两件事必不可少：

+ Register the vehicle and transfer ownership
+ Verify a parking space

These two steps involve a great deal of paperwork and complicated Japanese forms.  Taking a Japanese-speaker with you is practically a necessity if you cannot read or speak Japanese.  If you do not use a dealer, you will need the below (you may not need everything for a Yellow-Plate, but you will need most of it):

#### Documents you need to buy a car:
1.	**Alien Registration Card** (*gaikokujin torokushomeisho*) or Alien Registration Completion Certificate if your card has not been issued yet.
2.	**Personal Seal** (*inkan* or *hanko*) 
3.	**Personal Seal Certificate** (*inkan shomeisho*) from your local public office. 
4.	**Parking Space Certificate** (*shako shomeisho*) from the police station in the municipality where you applied for alien registration. (This may not be needed in a rural area.  See below on how to get one.)
5.	**Valid Driver's License** (*unten menkyo*)

#### Documents you need to transfer acar: 
All of the above as well as:

1.	**Deed of Transfer** (*joto shomeisho*)
2.	**Personal Seal Certificate** (*inkan shomeisho*) of the previous owner
3.	**Alien Registration Card** (or *juminhyo* if they are Japanese) of the previous owner.
4.	**Letter of Attorney** (*inin-jyo*) stamped by previous owner if possible
5.	**Compulsory Insurance Certificate** (*jibaiseki hoken-sho*) from the previous owner (or, if you are getting it for the first time, you can only do so once the *shaken* is in your name, so do shaken first.)
6.	**Shaken Inspection Certificate** (*shaken-sho*) from the previous owner
7.	**Proof of Payment of Automobile Tax** (*jidoushazei noufu shoumeisho*) from previous owner (may not be needed)

### How do I get proof of a parking space? 
Find the person who is renting (or willing to rent) you a parking space within 2km of where you live, often the landlord, building owner, real estate agent, building management company of the building you live in, and ask for an official document showing that the space is yours.  This document is a Certificate of Permission for Use of Parking (hokan basho shodaku shomei) and it must be stamped by the agent.  Then go to the local police station and fill out an application form as well as an application form for a badge (hyosho) so you can certify the space.  You have to draw two maps in a detailed manner: one of the area (including nearby landmarks) and one of the parking space, including the space number if there is one, the dimensions (in meters) of the spot and the width of any adjacent roads.   This takes about a week to process.  Note that small / light cars may not need this certificate in less urban areas.

Bring all necessary documents to the local Land Transport Office (ikuun jimusho).  If it is a different Office than the car was previously registered in, then you will have to get new license plates as well.  If possible, go together with the previous owner, bringing all relevant items.  Note that the officials will be very, very particular about details.  If you fill out a form wrong, you will have to do it over or come in another day.

*** Note that the Personal Seal Certificate is only valid for 3 months!  If it has been longer than that, for either the buyer or the seller, you need a new certificate (which may be difficult if the seller has left the country.) 

If you purchase through a dealer, you generally need only your Personal Seal Certificate and the Certificate of Permission for Use of Parking.  They will take care of the rest.

The entire process may take up to 10 days for a White Plate (but may be done in a day if a Yellow Plate.)

## WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF BUYING?
Used cars are worthless without shaken.  Period.  If the car you are buying has less than a year of shaken, it should be virtually free, unless it is fairly new and in very good condition.  The same logic applies when you are selling.  If you have no shaken left and do not get more, you might not be able to sell your car (or even give it away) and you will have to pay a scrap dealer to take it off your hands which can cost ¥10,000 to ¥20,000. 

The prices below are what you can expect to pay for a car with full shaken (valid for 2 years; 3 years if brand new)

|                                         |White Plate                 | Yellow Plate              |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
|Cost of a Car (used)                     | ¥240,000 – 300,000         | ¥160,000 – 220,000        |
|Cost of a Car (new)                      | ¥1,000,000 and up          | under ¥1,000,000          |
|Automobile Acquisition Tax               | 5% of the price of the car | 5% of the price of the car|
|Automobile Tonnage Tax (based on weight) | ¥50,000 – 75,000           | under ¥50,000             |
|Name Change                              | ¥10,000 - ¥25,000          | ¥3,000                    |

### Shaken
Shaken is a required road-worthy car inspection.  You can inspect your car by yourself, but most people bring their car to a dealer, who does everything for a fee.  (If you do it yourself – and you must have a decent command of Japanese to do it – note that White Plates are inspected by the "Transport Bureau Office" and Yellow Plates are inspected by the "Light Motor Vehicle Inspection Organization".)   Most people have it done by their dealer or a gasoline stand advertising  車検.  Shaken must be renewed within one month of the expiry date as shown on the sticker in your front window.

### WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF OWNING?
Owning a car is an expensive prospect in Japan, mainly because of inspection fees.  The mandatory insurance covers the other party, but it is strongly recommended that you get the optional Comprehensive Vehicle Insurance (ninni hoken) which covers third party expenses beyond the compulsory and which also covers you and your passengers.  Unlimited compensation insurance is highly recommended.

|    | White Plate | Yellow Plate |
|---|-----------------|------------------|
| Shaken (road-worthy car inspection, good for two years) | 120,000 yen and up | 70,000 - 100,000 yen |
| Older-Than-10-Year-Inspection (If your car is older than 10 years old, then you need a mini-shaken a year after you get shaken.) | (from 10,000 yen up to half the price of your shaken) |(from 10,000 yen up to half the price of your shaken)| 
| Compulsory Third Party Insurance	| (included with shaken) | (included with shaken)|
| Mandatory Liability Insurance (per year)	| 30,000 yen	| 20,000 yen |
| Optional Insurance (per year)	| 40,000 - 70,000 yen | 40,000 - 70,000 yen | 
| Automobile Tax (per year, depending on size) | 30,000 - 50,000 yen | 5,000 - 20,000 yen | 
| Gasoline	| about 110 yen per liter (about 4000 yen per tank) | about 110 yen per liter (about 4000 yen per tank) |
| Permanent Parking Space (per month)	| 0 yen (in the countryside) - 20,000 yen (in the big city) | 0 yen (in the countryside) - 20,000 yen (in the big city) | 
| Short-term Parking	| 100 - 500 yen per hour; 500 - 5000 yen per day | 100 - 500 yen per hour; 500 - 5000 yen per day| 
| Other Maintenance (tires, equipment, repairs) | 0 - 50,000 yen per year | 0 - 50,000 yen per year |
